Diátaxis
========

_A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring._

---

Diátaxis is a way of thinking about and doing documentation.

It prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a
systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

Diátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of
documentation - _tutorials_, _how-to guides_, _technical reference_ and
_explanation_. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that
documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.

Diátaxis solves problems related to documentation _content_ (what to write),
_style_ (how to write it) and _architecture_ (how to organise it).

As well as serving the users of documentation, Diátaxis has value for
documentation creators and maintainers. It is light-weight, easy to grasp and
straightforward to apply. It doesn’t impose implementation constraints. It
brings an active principle of quality to documentation that helps maintainers
think effectively about their own work.
