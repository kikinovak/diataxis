HOWTO guides
============

HOWTO guides are __directions__ that guide the reader through a problem or
towards a result. HOWTO guides are __goal-oriented__.

A HOWTO guide helps the user get something done, correctly and safely; it
guides the user’s _action_.

It’s concerned with _work_ - navigating from one side to the other of a
real-world problem-field.

Examples could be: _how to calibrate the radar array_; _how to use fixtures in
pytest_; _how to configure reconnection back-off policies_. On the other hand,
_how to build a web application_ is not - that’s not addressing a specific goal
or problem, it’s a vastly open-ended sphere of skill.

HOWTO guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish
things: the list of HOWTO guides in your documentation helps frame the picture
of what your product can actually _do_. A rich list of HOWTO guides is an
encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

Well-written HOWTO guides that address the right questions are likely to be the
most-read sections of your documentation.

HOWTO guides addressed to problems
----------------------------------

__HOWTO guides must be written from the perspective of the user, not of the
machinery__. A HOWTO guide represents something that someone needs to get done.
It’s defined in other words by the needs of a user. Every HOWTO guide should
answer to a human project, in other words. It should show what the human needs
to do, with the tools at hand, to obtain the result they need.

This is in strong contrast to common pattern for HOWTO guides that often
prevails, in which HOWTO guides are defined by operations that can be performed
with a tool or system. The problem with this latter pattern is that it offers
little value to the user; it is not addressed to any need the user has.
Instead, it’s focused on the tool, on taking the machinery through its motions.

This is fundamentally a distinction of _meaningfulness_. Meaning is given by
purpose and need. There is no purpose or need in the functionality of a
machine. It is merely a series of causes and effects, inputs and outputs.

Consider:

  * “To shut off the flow of water, turn the tap clockwise.”

  * “To deploy the desired database configuration, select the appropriate
    options and press __Deploy__.”

The examples above _look_ like examples of guidance, but they are not.

They represent mostly useless information that anyone with basic competence -
anyone who is working in this domain - should be expected to know. Between
them, standardised interfaces and generally-expected knowledge should make it
quite clear what effect most actions will have.

> We really do not need to be informed that we turn on a device using the power
> switch, but it is shocking how often HOWTO guides in software documentation
> are written at this level.

Secondly, they are disconnected from purpose. What the user needs to know might
be things like:

  * How much water to run and how vigorously to run it for a certain purpose.

  * What database configuration options align with particular real-world needs.

Tools appear in HOWTO guides as incidental bit-players, the means to the user’s
end. Sometimes of course, a particular end is closely aligned with a particular
tool or part of the system, and then you will find that a HOWTO guide indeed
concentrates on that. Just as often, a HOWTO guide will cut across different
tools or parts of a system, joining them up together in a series of activities
defined by something a human being needs to get done. In either case, it is
that project that defines what a HOWTO guide must cover.

> HOWTO guides are about goals, projects and problems, not about tools.

What HOWTO guides are not
-------------------------

__HOWTO guides are wholly distinct from tutorials__. They are often confused,
but the user needs that they serve are quite different. Conflating them is at
the root of many difficulties that afflict documentation. See [The difference
between a tutorial and a HOWTO guide][TODO] for a discussion of this
distinction.

In another confusion, HOWTO guides are often construed merely as procedural
guides. But solving a problem or accomplishing a task cannot always be reduced
to a procedure. Real-world problems do not always offer themselves up to linear
solutions. The sequences of action in a HOWTO guide sometimes need to fork and
overlap, and they have multiple entry and exit-points. Often, a HOWTO guide
will need the user to rely on their judgement in applying the guidance it can
provide.

Key principles
--------------

A HOWTO guide is concerned with work - a task or problem, with a practical
goal. _Maintain focus on that goal_.

Anything else that’s added distracts both you and the user and dilutes the
useful power of the guide. Typically, the temptations are to explain or to
provide reference for completeness. Neither of these are part of guiding the
user in their work. They get in the way of the action; if they’re important,
link to them.

A HOWTO guide serves the work of the already-competent user whom you can
assume to know what they want to do and to be able to follow your instructions
correctly.  


### Address real-world complexity

__A HOWTO guide needs to be adaptable to real-world use-cases__. One that is
useless for any purpose except _exactly_ the narrow one you have addressed is
rarely valuable. You can’t address every possible case, so you must find ways
to remain open to the range of possibilities in such a way that the user can
adapt your guidance to their needs.  


### Omit the unnecessary

In HOWTO guides, __practical usability is more helpful than completeness__.
Whereas a tutorial needs to be a complete end-to-end guide, a HOWTO guide does
not. It should start and end in some reasonable, meaningful place and require
the reader to join it up to their own work.  


### Provide a set of instructions

A HOWTO guide describes an _executable solution_ to a real-world problem or
task.  It’s in the form of a contract: if you’re facing this situation, then
you can work your way through it by taking the steps outlined in this approach.
The steps are in the form of _actions_.

“Actions” in this context includes physical acts, but also thinking and
judgement - solving a problem involves thinking it through. A HOWTO guide
should address how the user thinks as well as what the user does.  


### Describe a logical sequence

The fundamental structure of a HOWTO guide is a _sequence_. It implies logical
ordering in time, that there is a sense and meaning to this particular order.

In many cases, the ordering is simply imposed by the way things must be (step
two requires completion of step one, for example). In this case it’s obvious
what order your directions should take.

Sometimes the need is more subtle - it might be possible to _perform_ two
operations in either order, but if for example one operation helps set up the
user’s working environment or even their thinking in a way that benefits the
other, that’s a good reason for putting it first.  


### Seek flow

At all times, try to ground your sequences in the patterns of the _user’s_
activities and thinking in such a way that the guide acquires _flow_: smooth
progress.

Achieving flow means successfully understanding the user. Paying attention to
sense and meaning in ordering requires paying attention to the way human beings
think and act, and the needs of someone following directions.

Again, this can be somewhat obvious: a workflow that has the user repeatedly
switching between contexts and tools is clearly clumsy and inefficient. But you
should look more deeply than this. What are you asking the user to think about,
and how will their thinking flow from subject to subject during their work? How
long do you require the user to hold thoughts open before they can be resolved
in action? If you require the user to jump back to earlier concerns, is this
necessary or avoidable?

A HOWTO guide is concerned not just with logical ordering in time, but action
taking place in time. Action and a guide to it has pace and rhythm.
Badly-judged pace or disrupted rhythm are both damaging to flow.

At its best, HOWTO documentation gives the user flow. There is a distinct
experience of encountering a guide that appears to _anticipate_ the user - the
documentation equivalent of a helper who has the tool you were about to reach
for, ready to place it in your hand.  


### Pay attention to naming

__Choose titles that say exactly what a HOWTO guide shows__.

  * good: _How to integrate application performance monitoring_

  * bad: _Integrating application performance monitoring_ (maybe the document
    is about how to decide whether you should, not about how to do it)

  * very bad: _Application performance monitoring_ (maybe it’s about _how_ -
    but maybe it’s about _whether_, or even just an explanation of _what_ it
    is)

Note that search engines appreciate good titles just as much as humans do.

> HOWTO characteristics:
>
> * focused on tasks or problems
> * assume the user knows what they want to achieve

The language of HOWTO guides
----------------------------

_This guide shows you how to..._

> Describe clearly the problem or task that the guide shows the user how to
> solve.

_If you want x, do y. To achieve w, do z._

> Use conditional imperatives.

_Refer to the x reference guide for a full list of options._

> Don’t pollute your practical HOWTO guide with every possible thing the user
> might do related to x.

Applied to food and cooking
---------------------------

Consider a recipe, an excellent model for a HOWTO guide. A recipe clearly
defines what will be achieved by following it, and __addresses a specific
question__ (_How do I make...?_ or _What can I make with...?_)

![Recipe][img2]

It’s not the responsibility of a recipe to _teach_ you how to make something. A
professional chef who has made exactly the same thing multiple times before may
still follow a recipe - even if they _created_ the recipe themselves - to
ensure that they do it correctly.

Even following a recipe __requires at least basic competence__. Someone who has
never cooked before should not be expected to follow a recipe with success, so
a recipe is not a substitute for a cooking lesson.

Someone who expected to be provided with a recipe and is given instead a
cooking lesson will be disappointed and annoyed. Similarly, while it’s
interesting to read about the context or history of a particular dish, the one
time you don’t want to be faced with that is while you are in the middle of
trying to make it. A good recipe follows a well-established format that
excludes both teaching and discussion and focuses only on __how__ to make the
dish concerned.
