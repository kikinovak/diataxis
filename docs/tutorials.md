Tutorials
=========

A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor. A
tutorial is always learning-oriented.

---

A tutorial is a practical activity, in which the student learns by doing
something meaningful, towards some achievable goal.

A tutorial serves the user’s acquisition of skills and knowledge - their study.
Its purpose is not to help the user get something done, but to help them learn.

A tutorial in other words is a lesson.

It’s important to understand that while a student will learn by doing, what the
student does is not necessarily what they learn. Through doing, they will
acquire theoretical knowledge (i.e. facts), understanding, familiarity. They
will learn how things relate to each other and interact, and how to interact
with them. They will learn the names of things, the use of tools, workflows,
concepts, commands. And so on.
