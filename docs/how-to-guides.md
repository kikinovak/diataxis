How-to guides
=============

_How-to guides are **directions** that guide the reader through a problem or
towards a result. How-to guides are **goal-oriented**._

---

A how-to guide helps the user get something done, correctly and safely; it
guides the user’s action.

It’s concerned with work - navigating from one side to the other of a
real-world problem-field.

Examples could be: how to calibrate the radar array; how to use fixtures in
pytest; how to configure reconnection back-off policies. On the other hand, how
to build a web application is not - that’s not addressing a specific goal or
problem, it’s a vastly open-ended sphere of skill.

How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish
things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation helps frame the picture
of what your product can actually do. A rich list of how-to guides is an
encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

Well-written how-to guides that address the right questions are likely to be
the most-read sections of your documentation.
