Start here - Diátaxis in five minutes
=====================================

You don’t need to read everything on this website to make sense of Diátaxis, or
to start using it in practice. In fact I recommend that you don’t. The best way
to get started with Diátaxis is by applying it - to something, however small.

Read this page for a brief primer. Each section contains links to more in-depth
material; refer to that when you need it - when you’re actually at work, or
reflecting on the documentation problems you have encountered.
