Reference
=========

_Reference guides are **technical descriptions** of the machinery and how to
operate it. Reference material is **information-oriented**._

---

Reference material contains propositional or theoretical knowledge that a user
looks to in their work.

The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as
possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to
guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product
it describes.

In the case of software, reference guides describe the software itself - APIs,
classes, functions and so on - and how to use them.

Your users need reference material because they need truth and certainty - firm
platforms on which to stand while they work. Good technical reference is
essential to provide users with the confidence to do their work.
